    "### How to run your code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the code simply is running the cells in order on this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The very last cell contains \n",
    "\n",
    "```runGame(false, true) # (monte_carlo_enabled, random_play_enabled, board_width, board_height)```\n",
    "\n",
    "Set the first argument to true to enable MonteCarlo INSTEAD of Minimax. Use the second argument to enable random play. You can also optionally set the board heigh and board width (starts as 6x7).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Question Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. (10 points) Provide an upper bound for the number of positions in\n",
    "Connect Four on a 7×6 board. Explain how you derived your answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are are 6x7 = 42 different \"squares\" on the board. Each place has the option of 2 \"pieces\" in it, or blank. It is a permutation of all of the squares and possible states: for the first 3 squares, it would be 3x3x3 = 27 different permutations. Therefore, the upper bound is 3^42.\n",
    "\n",
    "This upper bound isn't quite accurate though. Players must alternate turns, significantly cutting down the state space. There are many impossible states with the previous estimate taken into account. The most impactful one is that there cannot be blank squares under pieces. There are also positions that are impossible to achieve after a players achieves 4 in a row (example: the bottom row having 4 in a row, and second row completely full as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "So I leave this 3^42 as a  crude upper bound estimate that could be improved upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. (15 points) Implement the game Connect Four in Julia. Implement\n",
    "the board, positions in the game, two players, moving in turns, and\n",
    "a test that determined whether the game has been won. Your implementation must detect illegal moves and raise an error when a move\n",
    "is illegal. The default board in Connect Four has a size of 7 × 6:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Implemented in the cells below. The game will end when a winning position is reached and will print the winner. Turns are taken, with the human player entering input manually and the AI making moves afterwards automatically. Illegal moves raise proper errors and displays messages to the user, allowing them to fix their mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. (25 points) Implement an intelligent agent to play Connect Four using\n",
    "the Minimax algorithm. Use a heuristic value function to terminate\n",
    "your search early. How many plys can you look ahead? What is the\n",
    "branching factor of your game tree?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimax is implemented in the secion \"Minimax\". Minimax can be run (without random play) by changing the last cell to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```runGame(false, false)``` \n",
    "\n",
    "Without random moves enabled, Minimax can look 6 plays ahead in a tolerable time (less than 10 seconds). Anymore than that and it isn't very fun to play. I usually leave it at 4 plays ahead and it makes a move within a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabling random moves makes minimax take quite a bit more time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The branching factor is the number of columns, which by default is 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(15 points) Consider a modified version of the Connect Four game in\n",
    "which both players have one additional type of move they can play:\n",
    "randomly drop one stone in an open column and force the next player\n",
    "to also randomly drop one stone in an open column. Modify your\n",
    "algorithm to play this modified version of Connect Four:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Random is enabled by setting the second parameter in runGame:\n",
    "\n",
    "```runGame(false, true)``` \n",
    "\n",
    "-1 is what you should enter as input to make a random move (instructions are printed when you start a game).\n",
    "\n",
    "**(35 points) Modify your agent to use Monte Carlo Tree Search instead\n",
    "of the Minimax algorithm. You can use a random playout or design\n",
    "a different strategy.**\n",

    "### Email Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the assumptions you made (your heuristic, your design decisions and justifications to those decisions, and the answers to the question)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design decisions includes number of plays ahead, the way you designed your random move and the exploration constant and the number of simulations in MCST?**\n",
    "\n",
    "MINIMAX algorithm heuristic works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check the lookup table: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"win\" => 1000,\n",
    "    \"lose\" => -1000,\n",
    "    \"draw\" => 0,\n",
    "    3 connected pieces => 3*3 (9 points), \n",
    "    2 connected pieces => 2*2 (3 points),\n",
    "    1 connected piece =>  1*1 (1 point)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- A player's score is calculated by scanning the entire board and adding the number of connected pieces.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Additionally, the number of blanks surrounding a piece are taken into account. For each piece on the board, it adds the following score:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"3 blanks\" => 3/10 of a point\n",
    "    \"2 blanks\" => 2/10 of a point\n",
    "    \"1 blank\"  => 1/10 of a point\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- This essentially works as a tie breaker for moves that make the same number of connected pieces on the board. Having more blanks (such as playing in the center of the board at the beginning) is better.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "- Of course, winning (4 or more connected pieces in the implementation) is worth a lot of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "- The board is scanned by the algorithm and points are assessed for both players. In order to calculate the current player's score, you take the difference of the 2 players.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*In the coded implementation, the score is always computed considering the second player as the Max player. The first player tries to minimize their score, and the second player tries to maximize their score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification:\n",
    "This strategy seems intuitively like a fair way to score. The more connected pieces you have, the closer you are to winning. Furthermore, 2 connected pieces is better than 2 separated pieces, so it is weighted more. The real justification is that this algorithm beats me every time I play!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "MONTECARLO is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following policy to check for \"common sense\" play: \n",
    "\n",
    "- If you can win with the next move, make it.\n",
    "- If the opponent is going to win after your next move, don't make that move!\n",
    "\n",
    "After this selection doesn't apply, then move to expansion and simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Expnasion & Simulation: Simulation is limited to 3 seconds, which simulates over 40,000 unique states. Random Play from both players initially when there are no stats available. If there are stats available for states, it will choose states with a higher win rate to sample statistcally more (weighted proportinally) over other states. There is a certain probability (1 - highest_win_rate) to randomly select a new unexplored state instead as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "I took the design decision to not limit the branching factor in this montecarlo algorithm. The reason being that 7 moves is not very many, and that way you don't miss any obvious moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it is an intuitive design for monte-carlo to work. Use random moves (especially when the branching factor is so small) to choose the next states. If stats are available about the win rates, then utilize this information to explore those states more frequently (statistically determined).\n",
    "\n",
    "MonteCarlo also plays quite well, and I have a tough time beating it (depending on how much time is given to the algorithm).\n"
